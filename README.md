Difficulty in tracking patient flow and history

💡 Our Solution

We propose a Digital Queue Management System that allows:

Patients to book tokens online (via app or web) or onsite (via kiosk)

Real-time tracking of queue status and wait times

Automatic notifications when the patient’s turn is near

Doctor/staff dashboards for seamless queue handling

Analytics for improving efficiency and patient experience
